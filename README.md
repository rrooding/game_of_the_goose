Game of Geese
=============

This is the main repo for distributing the cucumber features for
Kabisa's first Cucumber challenge.

The goal is to implement the system described by the cucumber features.
And to learn from each others architectural decisions.

This time it is a Dutch themed challenge.

The cukes are therefor in Dutch.


##Testing
Run the features:

```
$ bundle exec cucumber
```

Or use Guard during development:

```
$ bundle exec guard
```
